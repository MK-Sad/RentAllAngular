**RentAll Frontend**
**Single Page Application**
Is based on components depending on their functionality:
- *search items*
- *my items* - displaying userâ€™s items, add/edit items
- *my rentals* - displaying items rented by user and their status 
- *messages* - displaying pop-ups
- *user logging*.
There are 3 services responsible for communication with the backend and 2 services responsible for inside communication (*message service* and *share service*).
